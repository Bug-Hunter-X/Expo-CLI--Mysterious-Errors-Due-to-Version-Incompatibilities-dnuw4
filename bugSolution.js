The solution lies in carefully managing dependencies. First, check your `package.json` and ensure you're using an Expo SDK version that's supported by your Expo CLI version.  Then, check the compatibility of your third-party libraries with the Expo SDK version. You might need to update your libraries to versions that are compatible. Use `expo upgrade` to check and update Expo components. If a third-party library is incompatible, find an alternative or consider requesting compatibility updates from the library maintainers.

This error typically occurs when you're using a feature or library within Expo that isn't fully compatible with the specific version of Expo CLI you're using.  This often manifests as unexpected behavior, crashes, or build failures without clear error messages from Expo itself.  For example, trying to use a new React Native feature with an older Expo SDK version could cause this.  Another example could be incompatibility between a third-party library and the Expo environment.  Debugging this involves carefully checking the versions of all your dependencies (Expo CLI, Expo SDK, React Native, and third-party libraries).

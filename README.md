# Expo CLI: Mysterious Errors Due to Version Incompatibilities

This repository demonstrates a scenario where unexpected behavior or crashes occur in an Expo project due to version mismatches between Expo CLI, Expo SDK, React Native, and/or third-party libraries.  The error isn't immediately obvious from standard Expo error messages.

## Reproducing the Issue

The `bug.js` file contains code that might trigger the issue depending on your setup (specific version mismatch needed).  Try running the app and observe any unexpected behavior or crashes.  Note: The error might not consistently occur across all environments.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file shows how to resolve this issue by ensuring all dependencies are compatible. This often involves carefully reviewing and updating your `package.json` file to use the correct versions of Expo CLI, Expo SDK, and any third-party libraries.  Refer to the Expo documentation for version compatibility guidelines.
